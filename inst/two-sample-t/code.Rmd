This will be where the annotation elements of the display will be described:

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(mosaic)
```

You can do it this way
```{r}
t.test(hp ~ mpg > 25, data = mtcars, var.equal = TRUE)
```

Or this way, which is more general
```{r}
mod <- lm(hp ~ cyl, data = mtcars)
summary(mod)
```
